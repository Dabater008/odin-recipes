            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350Â°F. Peel and dice 1 small yellow onion (<em>about 1/2 cup</em>).</li>
                    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Add 1 pound lean ground beef and cook, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through and browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons tomato paste and 1 (<em>1-ounce</em>) packet taco seasoning. Cook until fragrant and the tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 cup water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the liquid has almost completely evaporated, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the toppings.</li>
                    <li>Core and dice 1 beefsteak tomato (<em>about 1 cup</em>). Halve, pit, and dice 1 small ripe avocado if using. Core and cut 1/4 medium iceberg lettuce head into fine shreds. Arrange 12 crunchy taco shells in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Divide the taco meat between the shells (<em>about 2 heaping tablespoons each</em>). Serve with the tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, shredded cheese, and sour cream for topping.</li>
